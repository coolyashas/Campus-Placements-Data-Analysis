# Campus Placement Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of campus placement data from a college. The dataset includes information on various factors such as academic performance, gender, work experience, and more, aiming to identify patterns that influence on-campus placements.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook File:** [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/coolyashas/Campus-Placements-Data-Analysis/blob/main/analysis.ipynb)
- **Dataset:** [data.csv](https://github.com/coolyashas/Campus-Placements-Data-Analysis/blob/main/data.csv)

## Project Highlights

Based on the plots derived and other statistical methods, the following conclusions were made.

### Conclusions

1. **Gender Influence:**
   - Male students have a slightly higher chance of getting placed than female students. Gender doesn't play a decisive role in campus placements.

2. **Academic Performance:**
   - Higher percentages in SSC and HSC indicate higher chances of placements, possibly reflecting early skill development or work ethic.

3. **Degree Type Impact:**
   - Students with undergrad degrees other than science and commerce have a lower probability of getting placed.

4. **Employability Test Results:**
   - Higher marks in employability tests show a minor increase in placement probability, suggesting potential irrelevance of test content.

5. **MBA Percentage:**
   - MBA percentage doesn't significantly impact placements; life skills such as communication, marketing, and work experience matter more.

6. **Work Experience:**
   - Students with work experience have a higher probability of getting placed, highlighting the importance of work experience in campus placements.
